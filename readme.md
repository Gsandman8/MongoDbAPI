# MongoDb CRUD

## Description
Utilizies MongoDB and the associated Mongoose ORM to create and link models and schemas to be able to effectively get, post, put and delete data in a simple RESTful API. The database has User and Thought models, with the User model having a self-referential friends subdocument, and the Thought model having the Reaction Schema as a subdocument array.

## Usage
This is purely backend code to interact with a simple database. You can clone this repository and run the server on localhost, but as of now, there is no front-end deployment to enable user interactivity.

## Technologies Used
MongoDB
Mongoose
Express.js
Node.js
